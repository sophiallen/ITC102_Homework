Tor is a software package/browser that lets you surf the web anonymously by routing your activity through multiple nodes. Downloading it, and some of the programs that work with it, will get you on an nsa watchlist. Tor gives you access to the dark net, although it doesn't give you a map of what sites exist on the dark net out how to use them. Most people find these dark net sites through word of mouth or from places like reddit. The presenters also advised using plugins when browsing dark net sites, such as plugins that disable scripts to help protect your computer and identity. Tor on its own is really good, but not as good as tor can be with those plugins. The dark net sites vary a lot in size, shadiness, and purpose. Many offer illegal goods and services in exchange for bitcoin, but again the speakers advised being careful when actually making purchases so as to best protect yourself.
