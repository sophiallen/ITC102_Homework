#finds blanks pre-tagged with <> in the text and replaces them
#with user input, then prints the (hopefully hilarious!) result.

#sample change!

    1. Have you tried turning it off and on again? 
    2. You aren't using Windows <verb> are you? Jeez, you should really switch to Google <verb>.
    3. Maybe you can figure it out on your own. Check to make sure you didn't leave out any important syntax, or mis-spell \"<noun>\" (for the tenth time today). 
    4. Can you rebrand the bugs as <adjective> features? No? Hm.
    5. Let's try using my favorite de-bugging tool, <noun>. Just type --<plural noun> to get it running, and ...
    Aha! You found it! Good job, you <adjective> <noun>, you. 
    6. Wait, what do you mean \"there are 27 new error messages now\"? Please refer to step one for further instructions."
